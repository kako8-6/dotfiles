# swappiness
# This control is used to define the rough relative IO cost of swapping and filesystem paging, as a value between 0 and 200.
# At 100, the VM assumes equal IO cost and will thus apply memory pressure to the page cache and swap-backed pages equally; 
# lower values signify more expensive swap IO, higher values indicates cheaper.

# Keep in mind that filesystem IO patterns under memory pressure tend to be more efficient than swapâ€™s random IO.
# An optimal value will require experimentation and will also be workload-dependent.

# For in-memory swap, like zram or zswap, as well as hybrid setups that have swap on faster devices than the filesystem, values beyond 100 can be considered.
# For example, if the random IO against the swap device is on average 2x faster than IO from the filesystem, swappiness should be 133 (x + 2x = 200, 2x = 133.33).
# At 0, the kernel will not initiate swap until the amount of free and file-backed pages is less than the high watermark in a zone.
# Default = 60
vm.swappiness = 30
